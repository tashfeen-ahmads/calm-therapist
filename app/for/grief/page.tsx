      whyFails="Generic AI therapy products forget that you lost someone. By session three they no longer reference your loss, and asking you to repeat the story of how someone died is a form of cruelty. They also fail at anniversaries — birthdays, death dates, holidays — which are the moments where grief intensifies and most people fall through the cracks. Calm Therapist holds onto these dates and meets you on them, not in a scripted way, but in a remembering way."
