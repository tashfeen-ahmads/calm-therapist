        "Depression is not sadness. It is the absence of energy where energy used to be. It is the shower that takes three days. It is the friend's text you saw, meant to reply to, and never did.",
        "Depression is the thing that makes the things that would help you feel impossible to do. It is recursive. Knowing what helps doesn't help.",
        "Most therapy products ask you to track your mood, set goals, and stay engaged. None of those things work when you can't get out of bed. They become another way to feel like a failure.",

      whyFails="Standard AI tools treat depression like a productivity problem. They build streak counters, daily check-ins, and quiz-style mood tracking. People with depression know exactly what these things do — they create another surface on which to disappoint yourself. Worse, they have no longitudinal memory. Every time you come back after a hard week, you start over. The disappearance is invisible to them. Calm Therapist is designed differently: there is no streak system, the journal works whether or not you wrote anything, and the agent remembers you across the gaps. That's the part that matters."
