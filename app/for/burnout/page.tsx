        "Burnout is not stress. Burnout is the state you reach after stress has been the baseline for so long that your body stopped sounding the alarm. It looks like still showing up. It feels like nothing.",
        "Burnout is the slow erosion of the things that used to matter. The hobbies you don't do anymore. The friends you don't text. The food that no longer tastes like anything. The sleep that doesn't repair.",
        "It is also, often, invisible to the people around you. You're still high-functioning. You're still hitting deadlines. The crash, when it comes, looks like surprise to everyone — except to you, where it had been a long time coming.",

      whyFails="Most AI tools treat burnout as a stress problem and offer breathing exercises. The breathing exercises are not the issue. The issue is that nobody has been watching the slow shape of your week. Calm Therapist is built to do exactly that — to track sleep mentions, work mentions, weekend mentions, and patterns over time. The point isn't fixing burnout in one session. The point is catching it earlier, by surfacing patterns that you cannot see from inside."
