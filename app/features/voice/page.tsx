It uses ElevenLabs' Conversational AI for natural speech — not the robotic text-to-speech of older tools — and it pairs that voice with the same memory architecture that powers the chat agent. Whatever you said in your last voice session, your last chat session, or your last journal entry is present here.",

        "The agent's voice is calm and unhurried. If you've chosen a direct tone, the voice changes — clearer, more decisive. If you've chosen warmth, the voice sits longer in the silences. The match between tone and voice is built in.",
        "What it never does: it never asks you to repeat yourself, it never forgets your name, it never plays generic comfort music, and it never holds a conversation that contradicts what you've already shared. If you said two weeks ago that your mother is unwell, the voice agent knows.",
