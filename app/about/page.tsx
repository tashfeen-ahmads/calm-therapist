          <Para>
            Calm Therapist is built by Implenix because the AI therapy market is failing the people
            who need it most. We mapped the 12 most common failure modes — memory loss, fake
            empathy, dangerous crisis responses, cultural blindness, the absence of a human
            handoff, the stigma men face when stepping into therapy spaces, and more — and built
            Calm Therapist to solve each of them.
          </Para>

          <Para>
            We are not chasing the next mental health buzzword. We are not building a habit-loop
            engagement engine. We are trying to make a tool that, when a person is having a hard
            moment at 3am, actually helps. The bar is whether someone vulnerable feels safer
            after using it. That is the only metric we care about.
