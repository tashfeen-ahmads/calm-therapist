              We store your sessions in encrypted form, scoped to your account, with strict access
              control. We use Anthropic&apos;s Claude API to generate responses. Anthropic does not
              train on data sent through their API. We use ElevenLabs for voice mode. Voice
              transcripts are routed through their conversational AI agent and stored in your
              account.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can export everything you&apos;ve ever said to Calm Therapist as a clean JSON or
              PDF, anytime. You can delete everything in one click. When you delete, the data is
              gone — not soft-deleted, not archived. Gone.

          <Section title="Where data lives">
            <p>
              Sessions live in our PostgreSQL database, encrypted at rest. Region selection is
              respected — EU users have data in EU regions; users in other regions can request the
              same. We are pursuing certifications consistent with HIPAA and GDPR data principles
              and intend to publish our subprocessor list quarterly.

          <Section title="The crisis exception">
            <p>
              The single exception: if the system detects language indicating immediate self-harm or
              danger, we may surface verified crisis resources for your region and, if you have
              opted in, contact your designated crisis contact. We do not contact authorities. We
              do not break encryption. The exception is human-readable, not a back door.
