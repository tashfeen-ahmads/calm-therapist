            <p>
              We store your sessions in encrypted form, scoped to your account, with strict access
              control. We use OpenAI&apos;s API to generate responses. OpenAI does not train on data
              sent through its API. We use ElevenLabs for voice mode. Voice
              transcripts are routed through their conversational AI agent and stored in your
              account.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can delete everything in one click from Settings. When you delete, the data is
              gone — not soft-deleted, not archived. Gone. A download of your record is on the way;
              until it ships we will not claim it here.
            </p>

          <Section title="Where data lives">
            <p>
              Sessions live in our PostgreSQL database, encrypted at rest. Region selection is
              respected — EU users have data in EU regions; users in other regions can request the
              same. We are pursuing certifications consistent with HIPAA and GDPR data principles
              and intend to publish our subprocessor list quarterly.

          </Section>

          <Section title="The crisis exception">
            <p>
              The single exception: if the system detects language indicating immediate self-harm or
              danger, we may surface verified crisis resources for your region and, if you have
              opted in, contact your designated crisis contact. We do not contact authorities. We
              do not break encryption. The exception is human-readable, not a back door.

          <Section title="Why we are built this way">
            <p>
              There is no investor here expecting a return on your attention. Nothing in this
              product is measured on time-on-app, and nothing is designed to make leaving feel
              bad. Chat is free because the point is that you can use it when you need it, and
              the parts that cost us money per minute are the only parts we ask you to cover.
