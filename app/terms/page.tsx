          <Section title="What Calm Therapist is — and isn't">
            <p>
              Calm Therapist is an AI companion built to help you reflect, name what you&apos;re
              feeling, and keep your space open between hard moments. It is <strong>not a
              substitute for licensed mental-health care</strong>, a clinical diagnosis, or a crisis
              service. If you are in danger or in immediate distress, please reach out to a
              human — a trusted person, a clinician, or your country&apos;s crisis line.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aura, our AI companion, can make mistakes. Treat its responses as a thinking partner,
              not a prescription.

          <Section title="Free access, and what a support pass buys">
            <p>
              Chat with Aura is free for everyone, with no trial period and no card. We do not
              intend to put chat behind a payment, and if that ever changed you would be told
              inside the app before it happened.
            </p>
            <p>
              Voice and circles are metered services that cost us money per minute, so they open on
              a <strong>support pass</strong>, from $5, processed by Ko-fi. What you pay determines
              how many voice minutes are added to your account and how long your circles seat stays
              open; both are shown in{" "}
              <Link href="/dashboard/settings" style={{ color: "var(--calm-forest)" }}>Settings</Link>.
              Voice minutes are yours outright and do not expire at the end of a month.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Ko-fi presents support as monthly by default.</strong> You can choose a single
              payment instead at the time of paying. If you do leave it monthly, Ko-fi charges you
              again each month and each charge adds another set of voice minutes and extends your
              circles seat. You can cancel at any time from your own Ko-fi account, and we will
              cancel it for you on request. Cancelling stops future charges; it never removes voice
              minutes already on your account, which remain yours. We never see or store your card
              details — Ko-fi and its payment processor handle that entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also ask you to tell us how Aura has been before a pass is issued. Any rating opens
              the gate, including a low one; your words stay private between you and us unless you
              separately tick the box allowing us to quote you. We never require a review to be
              public or positive in exchange for access.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unused voice minutes and unexpired circle access are refundable within 14 days if you
              ask us at the contact address below. Minutes you have already spent are not, since
              they have been paid onward to the voice provider.

          <Section title="Your data, your conversations">
            <p>
              You own what you write here. We don&apos;t train AI models on your conversations, and we
              don&apos;t sell your data. The full picture is in our{" "}

              Deletion is permanent — we can&apos;t recover a deleted account.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Safety routing">
            <p>
              When our safety classifier detects language consistent with crisis or risk of harm,
              Aura&apos;s reply will include crisis resources for your country and may pause the
              session. This is by design — your safety comes before flow.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Service availability">
            <p>
              We aim for high uptime, but Calm Therapist is software — outages, maintenance, and
              third-party API hiccups happen. We can&apos;t guarantee uninterrupted service. If voice
              is unavailable, text remains open.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Limitation of liability">
            <p>
              To the maximum extent permitted by law, Implenix and Calm Therapist are not liable
              for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the
              service. Our total liability for any claim is limited to the amount you paid us in
              the twelve months before the claim.
            </p>
            <p>
              The service is provided &quot;as is.&quot; We make no warranty that the service will be
              error-free, uninterrupted, or fit for a particular purpose.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Ending your account">
            <p>
              You can close your account anytime from Settings. We may suspend or close accounts
              that violate these terms, abuse safety routing, or threaten other users — we&apos;ll
              tell you why.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Changes to these terms">
            <p>
              If we change anything material, we&apos;ll let you know by email at least 14 days
              before it takes effect. Continued use after that means you accept the new terms.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Governing law">
            <p>
              These terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where Implenix is
              registered. Disputes will be handled in the courts of that jurisdiction unless local
              consumer-protection law gives you a different right.
