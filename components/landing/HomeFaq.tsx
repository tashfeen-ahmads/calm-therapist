  {
    q: "Is this really a free AI therapist?",
    a: `Yes. Chat with Aura is free for everyone, with no session cap and no card. The first ${CAP} members also get voice and circles free for four months. After that, voice and circles are part of an open space shown inside the app. Chat stays free.`,
  },
  {
    q: "Is an AI therapist a replacement for a real therapist?",
    a: "No. Aura is support: a place to think out loud, be heard, and see your own patterns, available at 2am. She does not diagnose or prescribe, and she tells you plainly when a licensed professional is the right next step. Many people use both.",
  },
  {
    q: "What makes Aura different from ChatGPT?",
    a: "Memory, rules, and safety. Aura remembers you across sessions, keeps replies short, pushes back on distorted thinking instead of agreeing, reads your cultural profile, and runs every message through a crisis-aware safety layer with the right hotline for your country.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are circles?",
    a: `Small anonymous text rooms of up to eight people carrying the same thing, 45 minutes a night, hosted by Aura with a human on call. You join as an anonymous animal and talk to each other. They open when ${CIRCLES_OPEN_AT} members have joined.`,
  },
  {
    q: "Which languages does Aura speak?",
    a: "English, Urdu, Hindi, Arabic, Spanish, and French, including Roman Urdu and Hinglish. Switch mid-sentence and Aura follows.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens to what I say?",
    a: `Your conversations are stored for you, in your account, and used only to help Aura remember you. ${BRAND.name} never sells your data and never trains a model on it. You can delete everything from Settings in one click.`,
  },
  {
    q: "What if I am in crisis?",
    a: "Aura slows down, stays with you, and shows the crisis line for your country. If you are in immediate danger, contact your local emergency number first. Aura is not an emergency service.",
  },
